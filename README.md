##  Overview
Scholar AI is an intelligent study companion designed to help students and learners maximize their productivity. Users can upload PDFs or images of study materials, and the app uses AI to generate quiz questions during Pomodoro breaks, turning study time into an interactive learning experience.

## How It Works
1. User uploads a PDF or image of study notes.
2. The app extracts the text content using OCR.
3. Users study using the Pomodoro technique (e.g., 25 minutes focus + 5 minutes break).
4. During breaks, AI generates questions based on the uploaded material to reinforce learning.
